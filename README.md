### ackamal's Dotfiles

## For use with i3-gaps

# Overview

A collection of scripts and config files to beautify my Manjaro desktop. Uses
a color scheme adapted from [Ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-colors).

Recently added multiple monitor support, and the ability to quickly send
workspaces in i3 from monitor to monitor.
